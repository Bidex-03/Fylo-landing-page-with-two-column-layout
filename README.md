## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS flexbox
- Desktop-first workflow
- CSS media query for mobile responsiveness

### What I learned

I learnt the proper way to make websites more responsive on devices. It's an avenue to master flexbox also. Moreso, got to know more on SVG images.

### Continued development

I want to learn more on how to use both flexbox and Grid respectively. Moreso, want to learn more on responsiveness.

### Useful resources
